# Depth-density curve fitting in Python

Use Bayesian statistics to estimate paramters for an analytical density profile
using observation data. Inference is performed using python + PyMC3 (not r+STAN).

Details of the method are outlined in:

    Manderson et al., 2019, Uncertainty quantification of density and stratification estimates with implications for predicting ocean dynamics, **JAOTEC**,
    [https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JTECH-D-18-0200.1]

Original STAN code is here [https://github.com/hhau/ddcurves2]
